This is a simple app to show you how you can turn your React application into a PWA.
Simply look at the commit history to see how you can do the same.

To run the project:

1. Clone the repo

2. `npm install`

3. `npm start`

webpack will compile all of the code in the src/ folder.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
